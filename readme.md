The manifest.json required for extension is located inside the public folder.

To load the extension locally. Go to extension -> Load unpacked -> point to dist folder (the build folder).

For development use
```
npm run build:dev
```
This is because the extension requires to point to the build folder, using this command you
won't have to rebuild on every save.
