Finding it difficult to choose the right font? 
Now test 1000+ free google font types on your website.

Font's adds personality to your website, a sans font on a page gives a different impression
of the page than a mono font. But picking the right one can be hard and time consuming. This is
one of the reason I created Font Tester. 

Now you can go to your website, click on the extension, test fonts and pick the one you like along with the code.

Though the extension is free to use forever, there is an optional license you can buy to support open-source development. This will provide me with funds to develop upcoming tool for Python developers.

### Contributing

The `manifest.json` required for extension is located inside the public folder.

To load the extension locally. Go to extension -> Load unpacked -> point to dist folder (the build folder).

For development use
```
npm run build:dev
```
This is because the extension requires to point to the build folder, using this command you
won't have to rebuild on every save.

For development you can also use 
`npm start`, but you won't be able to load it as extension but as a react app.
